# dino_hack_game

I have done it by using Pycharm which is an python code editor.
# First go to your browser and enter this url:
    chrome://dino


# And then right click on the screen and click inspect


# Then go to console

# And then enter this code
Runner.instance_.gameOver = () => {}

# And then press enter

And now you can beat anyone in the dino game!!
